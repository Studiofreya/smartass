# SmartAss IRC bot

This is an attempt to create an IRC bot, which can talk back to users when they mention it's name.

At the moment it's in a very early stage of development, and main focus is to adhere to the IRC-protocol and to implement some features here and there.

What language engine it'll interface is yet to be decided, but it has to be MIT-licensed (or similar to the MIT license) and written in C++, preferably modern C++.
